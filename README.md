Some my best codeforces solutions.

These are handpicked from 600+ solutions because they fall into some category below:
-Faster than AI 
-Used less memory than AI
-Had better code structure than AI

Used AI was Chat GPT 4.0

These make up the bulk and lastly some picks are:

-Bit challenging for my skills and were nicely done... IMO :D

Read me is in english, although the analysis in codefiles is in finnish. As contenxt here is to "show activity" to potential future employers I recon it would not be time efficient to translate analysis in codefiles.
