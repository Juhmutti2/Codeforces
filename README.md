Some of my best Codeforces solutions.

These are handpicked from 600+ solutions because they fall into some category below:

- Faster than AI
- Used less memory than AI
- Had better code structure than AI

Used AI was ChatGPT 4.0. The role of AI was more like a virtual partner:
"Hey, I was better here", "Oh my, it was way better there".

These make up the bulk, and lastly some picks are:

- Bit challenging for my skills and were nicely done... IMO :D

The README is in English, although the analysis inside code files is in Finnish.
The context here is to show activity to potential future employers, and I consider it not time-efficient to translate the analysis.

### Note about AI

Interestingly enough, in some solutions it became very obvious that AI lacks semantic understanding — that is, deeper understanding of what we are trying to accomplish.
In some cases this led to inefficient or unnecessarily complicated solutions.

CF_stats shows my progress at Codeforces.

Screencaptures show my email to further prove it's my progress.
Stats are visible due to an extension on codeforces.com, hence pictures instead of links.

My Codeforces ambitions were (and are) purely about learning.
Using AI in competition is not nice.

The progress is relevant to show the number of solved problems, and at a certain point the training was quite intense.
