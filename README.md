Some my best codeforces solutions.

These are handpicked from 600+ solutions because they fall into some category below:
-Faster than AI 
-Used less memory than AI
-Had better code structure than AI

Used AI was Chat GPT 4.0. Role of AI was sort of virtual partner: "Hey I was better here", "oh my, it was way better there". 

These make up the bulk and lastly some picks are:

-Bit challenging for my skills and were nicely done... IMO :D

Read me is in english, although the analysis in codefiles is in finnish. As context here is to "show activity" to potential future employers I recon it would not be time efficient to translate analysis in codefiles. 

Note about AI:
Interestingly enough, in some solutions it became very obvious that AI lacks semantical understanding. That is deeper understanding of what we are trying to accomplish. In some cases it lead to inefficient or complicated solutions. 

CF_stats shows my progress at Codeforces. 

Screencapture shows my email to further proof it's my progress. 
Stats are visible due to extension on codeforces.com hence picture and not a link. 
My Codeforces ambitions were / are learning only; using AI in competition is not nice. 
Progress is relevant to show amount of solutions and at certain point training was quite intense.
